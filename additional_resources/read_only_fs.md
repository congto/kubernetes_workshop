# Read-Only File System Error in Kubernetes Pod

The basic symptom you will see is that the pod is in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. This usually happens when the container tries to write to a file system that is mounted as read-only. As there is no additional information in the pod description, you will need to check the logs of the container to see the specific error message.

Log files then unveil the reason of the failure:

```

How to fix it. In general, you need to update the pod spec with appropriate volume mounts like this:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      securityContext:
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        # ... other securityContext settings
      volumeMounts:
        - name: nginx-cache
          mountPath: /var/cache/nginx
  volumes:
    - name: nginx-cache
      emptyDir: {}
```

Unfortunately in our example it is more complicated than that. It is not enough to just mount the `/var/cache/nginx` directory as an `emptyDir` volume. We also need to ensure that the nginx configuration file and other directories are mounted correctly, and that the security context is set to allow nginx to run without root privileges.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  namespace: tss-namespace
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx
spec:

  containers:

      image: nginx
      securityContext:

        capabilities:
          drop:
            - ALL
        privileged: false
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 1000
      volumeMounts:
        - name: nginx-config
          mountPath: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
          subPath: nginx.conf
          readOnly: true
        - name: nginx-cache
          mountPath: /var/cache/nginx
        - name: nginx-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx
        - name: nginx-tmp
          mountPath: /tmp
        - name: nginx-run
          mountPath: /var/run

  volumes:
    - name: nginx-config
      configMap:
        name: nginx-config
    - name: nginx-cache
      emptyDir: { }
    - name: nginx-logs
      emptyDir: { }
    - name: nginx-tmp
      emptyDir: { }
    - name: nginx-run
      emptyDir: { }
